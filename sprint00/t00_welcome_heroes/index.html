        <h2 id="Superhero">What makes a superhero?</h2>
        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do 
            them in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to be a superhero, 
            <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, 
            and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman 
            could be considered a superhero.<br>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a 
            regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it's a good guy with a 
            superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing 
            something that a normal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

        <p>Hulk</p>
        <p>The Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
            Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the 
            debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the 
            character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented 
            by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a 
            limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a 
            physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent each other.
